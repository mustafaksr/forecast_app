Setting presets to: medium_quality

Fitting with arguments:
{'enable_ensemble': True,
 'eval_metric': MASE,
 'hyperparameters': 'light',
 'known_covariates_names': [],
 'num_val_windows': 1,
 'prediction_length': 48,

Inferred time series frequency: 'h'
Provided train_data has 148060 rows, 200 time series. Median time series length is 700 (min=700, max=960). 

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'target'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'MASE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.

Starting training. Start time is 2024-07-19 10:55:11
Models that will be trained: ['Naive', 'SeasonalNaive', 'RecursiveTabular', 'DirectTabular', 'ETS', 'Theta', 'TemporalFusionTransformer']
Training timeseries model Naive. Training for up to 1.1s of the 8.5s of remaining time.
	Time limit exceeded... Skipping Naive.
Training timeseries model SeasonalNaive. Training for up to 1.0s of the 7.2s of remaining time.
	Time limit exceeded... Skipping SeasonalNaive.
Training timeseries model RecursiveTabular. Training for up to 1.0s of the 6.0s of remaining time.
	Warning: Exception caused RecursiveTabular to fail during training... Skipping this model.
	Not enough time left to train models. Consider specifying a larger time_limit. Time remaining: -1.64s
Training timeseries model DirectTabular. Training for up to 0.6s of the 3.2s of remaining time.
	Warning: Exception caused DirectTabular to fail during training... Skipping this model.
	Not enough time left to train models. Consider specifying a larger time_limit. Time remaining: -0.79s
Training timeseries model ETS. Training for up to 0.5s of the 1.8s of remaining time.
	Time limit exceeded... Skipping ETS.
Training timeseries model Theta. Training for up to 0.6s of the 1.8s of remaining time.
	Time limit exceeded... Skipping Theta.
Training timeseries model TemporalFusionTransformer. Training for up to 0.9s of the 1.8s of remaining time.
	-6.4308       = Validation score (-MASE)
	3.92    s     = Training runtime
	0.42    s     = Validation (prediction) runtime
Not fitting ensemble due to lack of time remaining. Time left: -2.6 seconds
Training complete. Models trained: ['TemporalFusionTransformer']
Total runtime: 11.23 s
Best model: TemporalFusionTransformer
Best model score: -6.4308
Model not specified in predict, will default to the model with the best validation score: TemporalFusionTransformer
Additional data provided, testing on additional data. Resulting leaderboard will be sorted according to test score (`score_test`).
